## Hodl NTRO

Since NTRO is minted on a bonding curve, any supply increase makes the price go up. Combined with the incentive not 
to sell early (the buy/sell tax) it makes NTRO a great asset to HODL.

We are still very early in the game. Count with us:

- Every new NTRO is 0.000001 BNB more expensive
- The first 1 NTRO was exactly 0.000001 BNB
- ...
- The 10,000th NTRO was worth 0.01 BNB
- The 100,000th NTRO will cost 0.1 BNB and
- The 1,000,000th NTRO will cost a whooping 1 BNB

One million supply is a long way to go, but it's not impossible. There are dog coins with no utility out there worth 
way more. 

## Speculate on ROKT value

ROKT is a governance token with core value to the protocol. With the protocol adoption and slower relative issuance 
the market value increases. There are other factors that play for higher ROKT value:

- it's being locked in staking pools decreasing the circulating supply
- being a governance token, there's an incentive to accumulate ROKT for having a stronger word in the future 
  development of the protocol.

Check the ROKT price action on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket)
  
## Provide liquidity

If you're holding some ROKT and BNB and want to give it some utility (and help to make the protocol more robust), you can 
stake in the [BNB/ROKT Pool on PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/add/BNB/0xc0731c3A2cbd795c6AB6dd7Fe2146Edc51CC21B0).

It doesn't end here though. You go to the [Apescape FARM](https://apescape.eth.link/#/app/farm) and stake your new and 
shiny LP tokens in the BNB/ROKT Pool to get the juiciest ROKT rewards.

## Stake in the BNB pools

What's unique about our protocol is that rewards are paid in BNB. That's right, for staking in our 
[EARN pools](https://apescape.eth.link/#/app/earn), you're getting BNB, not some random token.

Rewards are slit 50/50 between the NTRO Pool and the ROKT Pool and it's up to you to choose your favorite pool with 
the right risk/reward ratio.

Where do the rewards come from you may ask? That's the cool part. Two sources actually:

- NTRO is bought and sold through a [smart contract](/apescape/contracts). Every buy and sell is taxed with a 10% tax 
  which is split between the NTRO and ROKT pools.
- The BNB locked when buying NTRO is staked on PancakeSwap (as s BNB/Cake pair) and those rewards are also 
  distributed to our pool stakers.

## Farm ROKT

We've settled that the value of ROKT is bound to grow with the protocol usage. Why not get more then?

There are multiple FARM pools. The core ones being

- **BNB/ROKT pool**. This is the famous pool #2 (even though it's listed first). You provide liquidity to the ROKT token 
  on PancakeSwap, we give you a lot of ROKT as a reward. 
- **NTRO pool**. Specifically created for those who aped primarily into NTRO. Holding NTRO is great but why not make it 
  bring you something extra. Staking it in the NTRO pool will bring you some bonus ROKT.

We are soon opening new pools to reward people who have been rugged in other projects so **stay tuned**!

## Stir &amp; Shake

The game is played best by combining your strategies.

- **Got some NTRO?** Great, you can stake it in the ROKT masterchef to earn some ROKT on top.
- **Earning BNB from staking in one of the BNB pools?** Invest your profits to get more NTRO or ROKT (or both). Did you 
  know you can reinvest your rewards automatically using auto compounding?
- **Got a bunch of ROKT and some spare BNB?** Stake in the BNB/ROKT LP pool and gain the highest rewards
- **Are you tired of hoarding NTRO?** Dump it and let others enjoy the rewards :) 

## Make it grow

The protocol value grows with the amount of its users. That's not our invention - it's the same as everywhere else.
Invite your frends. Explain the project to them. 

We want more!

- The more there's locked in NTRO, the juicier the BNB rewards. 
- The more ROKT holders, the more robust protocol we have. 
- The more liquidity on PancakeSwap, the more dump-resistant ROKT is.
