# Nitro Index (NTRO)

NTRO is a yield generating index token backed by staked BNB and CAKE. Minted through a bonding curve, NTRO can be acquired by anyone who sends BNB to a smart contract. It will start with zero supply (no pre-mine). The smart contract is responsible for selling half of the BNB to CAKE tokens and providing liquidity to Pancake Swap. It then stakes the LP token to continuously earn yields.

### Nitro Index Tokenomics

* Each token minted is a tiny bit more expensive than the previous one. The more tokens minted (greater the supply) the more expensive the token is.
* There is a 10% tax on each token sale to and from the contract. So if a user buys 100 BNB worth of NITRO, they will pay 10 BNB as tax.
* 50% of the tax is distributed to NITRO stakers on the **BNB Reward Pool**.
* Half of the resulting 90 BNB is sold for cake and added as liquidity together with the BNB (50% BNB/ 50% CAKE) to Pancake Swap.
* The resulting LP is then staked in Pancake Swap for yield farming at a current APY of \~60%.
* The yield (In CAKE) is continuously harvested, sold for BNB and distributed to the BNB reward pool rewarding NITRO stakers.

Early buyers are rewarded with a bigger share of the index for taking the initial investment risk. Long term holders benefit from the 10% tax applied on each purchase and sale of NITRO.

### **Long term sustainability through the buy and burn model. **

**Every 10 minutes**, a small portion of the total liquidity in the BNB/ROKT pool (0.01%) is used to buy and burn NTRO, forever locking BNB/CAKE tokens in Pancake Swap. This continuously generates interest to NTRO and ROKT stakers. The buy and burn model creates a mutual beneficial relationship between the DAO members and its products.
