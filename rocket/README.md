# Governance Token (ROKT)

ROKT can be earned by anyone who provides value to the network. The current ROKT issuance allocation is the following:

* **50x BNB/ROKT LP** - Liquidity providers of ROKT and BNB.
* **25x DAO Treasury** - Fully Controlled by ROKT token holders.
* **15x Core Team** - The creators of the DAO.
* **5x  NTRO Stakers** - Users who stake NTRO.

ROKT tokens are the key to the unstoppable engine, can be staked to earn BNB and used for protocol governance.&#x20;

### The DAO is about rewarding its members

The DAO's mission is to build products that facilitate capital allocation, creation and coordination while always generating value to its members.

### An engine for unstoppable rewards&#x20;

The main goal of the protocol is to build useful DeFi tools and primitives with auto-cash-flow embedded in them. As long as these tools are useful to its users, members of the DAO should continuously earn revenue from their adoption. Each tool will always set aside a percentage of the fees to lock funds auto-compounding forever. In time this should become a meaningful part of the protocol revenue source. &#x20;
