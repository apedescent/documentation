# Earn

For a long time, even in the 2000's, your options for earning passive income have been:

1. Real Estate
2. High Yield Savings
3. CD's
4. Dividend stocks

Some of these options are more passive than others. Some actually require quite a bit of dedication. Your truly passive options are going to get you 1-10% annual yield, with 10% on the extreme high end and most options less (or much less) than 5%.

**Through auto compounding on Apescape, you can earn 10x APY or more compared to your traditional passive income options. **

For example:

Dividend stock - 7% annual yield

NTRO Pool - **76% annual yield** - 115% w/ Autocompounding (learn more about Autocompounding in the next section)

**Why are yields so high?**

1. Low overhead
2. Low fees
3. High demand for borrowing and leverage
4. Predictable monetary policy
5. Profit from providing liquidity
