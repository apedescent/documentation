# Intro to DEFI

## What is DEFI?

DEFI - Decentralized Finance - is the idea that the entire financial system can be rebuilt without reliance on any single centralized entity like a bank.&#x20;

DEFI started to gain traction in 2019 using Ethereum Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are rules and workflows defined in code on the blockchain. They allow for decisions to be made and action to be taken without any human interaction. Smart Contracts can be made to operate autonomously.&#x20;

While a bank needs to make a profit from customer money, a DEFI smart contract has no overhead, no employees, no requirement to pay itself, and no ability to unpredictably stop or pause a service. Of course incentive structures exist to make building in DEFI worthwhile, but builders in DEFI aren't incented to be middlemen or to take custody of users funds.

The inherent problem with trusting a third party for service was made very clear in 2020 and 2021 when we saw centralized entities (eg. Robinhood) restrict trading on certain assets during periods of huge volatility, and locking people out of trading or transferring their own funds. In DEFI, that would never happen. The cost of your transaction may go up due to demand, but in you'll never be able to not sell your token because someone pressed stop.

Like any emerging technology ecosystem, DEFI is developing rapidly. Barriers to entry are lowered by products that make entry simple, and that mitigate risks - like contract audits and insurance. Total Value Locked (TVL) in DEFI has grown from about $20B TVL at the beginning of 2021 to about $120B TVL in June 2021. To put that in context, American Express has total deposits of about $100B and JPMorgan Chase has about $2.2T. DEFI is more than a bank, its growth and scale cannot be denied, and it still represents just a fraction of the financial landscape. We're still early.
