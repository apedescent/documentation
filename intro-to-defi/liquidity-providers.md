# Liquidity Providers

Before Automatic Market Makers (AMM), LP's - Liquidity Providers - had to develop technology to create buy and sell orders automatically on markets. This was a huge barrier to entry because if you were to look for this As-a-Service, you'd be facing tens of thousands of dollars per month in fees in addition to all the actual funds of each asset required to provide liquidity.&#x20;

AMM's provide a scalable way for anyone to provide liquidity to a trading pair and earn fees from transactions on that market.&#x20;

AMM's are based on a bonding curve like in the model below. This means that when a buy order is placed, the price goes up along the curve. When a sell order is placed, the price goes down along the curve.&#x20;

This formula replaces the need for complex trading bots on traditional exchanges.&#x20;

Instead of placing a buy order for a particular price level, all you need to do is put in the amount of an asset you would like to purchase, and the corresponding output will be calculated instantly for you to see.&#x20;

To provide liquidity, it is as simple as adding your assets, at a 50/50 balance in the example below.

**As a result of providing liquidity, your wallet with have an LP token corresponding to your pair. **To stake as a BNB/ROKT LP on Apescape, you'll [add liquidity on PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/add/BNB/0xc0731c3A2cbd795c6AB6dd7Fe2146Edc51CC21B0) and receive LP tokens.** **This is the token you take to [the Ape Escape dashboard](https://apescape.eth.link/#/app/farm) to stake and earn $ROKT. In addition to ROKT, you will also be earning trading fees from the LP while you are staking your LP tokens on Ape Escape.&#x20;

Autocompounding your LP position means that the Ape Escape smart contracts will automatically take your ROKT rewards, sell half for you, provide more liquidity for you, and stake that LP token - automatically. This is where the magic is.
