# Autocompounding

Remember learning about compound interest in school? Compound interest occurs when interest earned gets added to the principal amount invested, and then the interest rate gets applied to the new (larger) principal. When you compound you earn interest on your interest, which results in exponential returns. This is not new, nor is it specific to DEFI or crypto. Compounding is the best magic in finance and the key to growing your funds year over year.&#x20;

In DEFI, a smart contract has to be called to distribute your earned rewards to you. This call has costs, it costs some gas to execute that transaction on the blockchain, and you have to go make this call every time you want to harvest your rewards and add them to your principal and enjoy compounding.&#x20;

**Apescape is building autocompounding into every applicable product. **Automation (that's the auto in autocompounding) handles all of the steps of compounding with maximum efficiency. Remember when we said Apes Together Strong? Each time anyone interacts with the contract, it will compound positions for **everyone **with** **positions in that pool. That's right, where a bank would maximize fees, we've batched together transactions for efficiency. What is good for one is good for all here.&#x20;

You can toggle autocompounding On and Off in the upper right of each farm, see how much has been converted for you, and a timer that shows you how long it has been since the last compound on each farm.

**APY vs APR:**

APY is the % return annually if you were to compound daily: APY = (1 + r/n)n â€“ 1

* r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
* n = the number of times your product calculates compound interest in a year (e.g. 12 for monthly, or 4 for quarterly).

APR is the % return annually if you were to just accrue interest with no compounding.&#x20;

In this example: **$10,000 into the ROKT pool yields 22,393% APY and 545.62% APR**

**APR: $64,562 earned after 1 year**

**APY: $2,239,371.26 earned after 1 year of daily compounding**
